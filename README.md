A video analysis 

## neuralnetwork.ipynb
A series of neural network examples including the following:

1. A simple neural network implementation used to create a model based on the MNIST dataset to test and train. Accuracy is relatively stable at 0.9764, 97.64%.

2. A Convolutional Neural Network implementation given the same MNIST dataset for comparison of improved accuracy. Accuracy is relatively stable at 0.9912, 99.64%.

3. A Convolutional Neural Network implementation given the CIFAR10 dataset to test and train. Accuracy dropped in comparison to the previous implementation which is 0.8146, 81.46%.

4. Data Augmentation example using a Convolutional Neural Network the the MNIST dataset.
